WorldEditCUI
------------

A graphical user interface for WorldEdit. WorldEditCUI is designed 
to assist in using WorldEdit, as well as preventing accidental errors.

Please note that this is not WorldEdit, which allows you to make changes
to your world, but WorldEditCUI, a frontend for WorldEdit. You must have
WorldEdit installed on your server or in SinglePlayerCommands to use this mod.
 

Compiling
---------

You will need a [LiteLoader MCP workspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpvo-F4AFc), once you have that set up simply import the project and run the ant build script.
